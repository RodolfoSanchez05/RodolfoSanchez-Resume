        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hi, My name is Rodolfo Sanchez and I am a real estate agent available for your personal interests. I have many talents which can be brought into the business world. I come from a small city in California which is where I grew up in and I never knew I would be going into a real estate environment. I grew up being interested in making video games so this path never really crossed my mind until I was in college. I had my mind centered about going to Florida and becoming a video game developer but soon I grew up and realized that I can only go so little with that. I began to get stuck and didn't know what to really do until I found out about real estate. I looked into work, studying psychology, pharmacy, biology, education, etc. but nothing really peaked my interests like real estate did. I began to look into real estate more and more in college and realized it was something I liked until I realized I am not that social so I didnâ€™t know how I was going to fulfill that job. I didnâ€™t stop there. 
 <br><br>

        I was determined to make this happen after seeing the amount of freedom you can have and how you will be your own boss was the best thing  I've ever heard. I began to work on getting my real estate licensing and once I did I thought I had finally done it until I realized how hard this job can really get. I almost gave up my real estate career because of the struggles at the beginning and I saw no progress. I soon came to the realization that real estate doesnâ€™t just give you the skills to sell but it gives you the skills to know the market. I looked into different types of real estate and began a new journey. I was interested in cars as well so what better job than to work at a hyper car dealership. I made my first car sale which made me a lot of money. I was having the best time of my life working there until I ran into a problem and I had to move out of town which changed my life but I sucked it up and went back into the real estate business.<br><br>

        So after all of the ups and downs I went through I learned that real estate was a great option for me because of the elasticity it gives you and the lessons you learn. It is not only becoming a real estate agent but becoming a talented marketer. Next time you are thinking of getting into real estate I would advise you to definitely look into it at least a little bit to get familiar with the market because you could almost possibly help yourself with better financial decisions later on in life.
